# Tkinter Drag-and-Drop GUI Builder

This program is a Python library that generates Tkinter user interfaces with drag-and-drop functionality. It provides an intuitive way to build graphical interfaces for Python applications.

## Usage

To use this program, the user needs to run the `main.py` program. This will open the GUI builder window where the user can add widgets to the interface by dragging and dropping them onto the canvas.

Once the user has finished building the interface, they can save the Python file which will include the final Tkinter interface code. The generated code can be used in the user's Python project to create the user interface.

## Installation

To use this program, the user needs to have Python 3 installed along with the Tkinter library. Tkinter should be included with most Python distributions, but if it is not installed, it can be installed using pip:

```
$ pip install tkinter
```

Once Tkinter is installed, the user can simply download the program and run the `main.py` file to start the GUI builder.
