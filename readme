# Python Drag-and-Drop GUI Builder with Tkinter

This software is a Python library designed to create user interfaces with drag-and-drop functionality. It is built on top of the Tkinter library and provides an intuitive way to build graphical interfaces for Python applications.

## Installation

To use this library, the user needs to have the Tkinter library installed. Tkinter should be included with most Python distributions, but if it is not installed, it can be installed using pip:

```
$ pip install tkinter
```

Once Tkinter is installed, the user can simply download and import the library into their Python project.

## Usage

To use the library, the user needs to import the `tkinter` and `tkinter_builder` modules:

```python
import tkinter as tk
import tkinter_builder as builder
```

Once the modules are imported, the user can create a new window and add widgets to it using drag-and-drop functionality:

```python
root = tk.Tk()
builder.create_window(root, "My Window", 800, 600)

# Add a label widget
label = builder.add_label(root, "Hello, World!", 100, 100)

# Add a button widget
button = builder.add_button(root, "Click me!", 200, 200)

# Start the main event loop
root.mainloop()
```

The above code creates a new window with the title "My Window" and dimensions of 800x600 pixels. It then adds a label widget with the text "Hello, World!" at position (100, 100) and a button widget with the text "Click me!" at position (200, 200).

The user can add various other widgets to the window, including text boxes, check boxes, radio buttons, and more. The library also provides various layout managers to help the user position the widgets on the window.
